time has flown by  
and the black heads greyed  
memories tolling up the mind  
life has been a one way lane  

the good the bad and the summers  
have lived all the same  
walking down the paths set long ago  
learned and free yet reined and tamed  

every evening returning back to the den  
a day old but a decade aged  
they say it's the chemicals acting  
but deep down it's the alienation at work  

I fancy meeting you some where, some time  
you taking a moment to recognise me  
the locks in your hair have gone grey  
as the thing between you and me  

The feeble cry pinches the ear  
about an arm's length small  
yet somehow it is supposed to rise  
to live and fight, to love and to carry on
