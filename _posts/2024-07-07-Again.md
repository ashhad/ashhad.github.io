And it happened again  
before I could have stopped it  
before I could have known  
I fell for you again  

I had waited for it once  
begged for it every single day  
but today when I was all prepared  
I felt funny in the knees again  

The smile that your name stirred  
the occasional unknown blush  
the long lost warmth of your sight  
all left e defeated again  

I had tried not to look back  
cause that was not the way I was headed  
Hadn't you looked back while leaving  
I would not have felt helpless again  

It had been years now,long time  
Of making and breaking promises  
Of winning and losing battles everyday  
Of not loving you again
