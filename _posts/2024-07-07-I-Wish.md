I wish you were here  
beside me around my arms  
your body leaning against mine  
head resting under my chin  

I wish you were here  
for that beautiful good morning  
that first cup of coffee  
and warm smile thereafter  

I wish you were here  
every time I crossed the road  
holding hands tightly  
looking over each others shoulders  

I wish you were here  
with your endless stories  
stories of a parallel world  
stories to fill the empty evenings  

I wish you were here  
to spice up the Sunday noon  
to excite the evening walks  
and the rains would have been better  

I wish you were here  
for the walk back home  
for the last bite of the cone  
for the last bye of the night
