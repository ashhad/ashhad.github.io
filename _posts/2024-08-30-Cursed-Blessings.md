We are blessed  
To be alive and be able  
With food and an appetite   
To earn a living, save and splurge  
With a mind to think and imagine  
To be able to move and explore  
To be able to see, hear and speak  
With a family and bonds  
And despite all of this  
We are cursed to be unhappy  
Cursed to forever look for peace  
To eat but not be satisfied  
To earn more but still be poor  
With anxiety, trauma and horrors  
To be able to move but have nowhere to go  
To be able to feel but not express  
To be bound in bonds but not be connected  
To keep on living but not feel alive
