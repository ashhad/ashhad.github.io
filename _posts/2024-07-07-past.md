The grey shades of my hollow past  
getting me down to the dark roads  
clutching me tightly around my neck  
the dementors of my past feed upon me  

I have been running away from them  
running away from the demons within  
looking for the faintest ray of light  
plotting my escape from this purgatory  

That golden beacon of light is too far  
filtering through the prism of cobwebs  
I can feel the warmth it spreads  
The many colors dancing on my skin  

A new morning has filled up the canvas  
and with it I continue my run  
for the bright light that guides me  
and keeps the creatures in hiding  

I have waited a long time now  
the winged angel is yet to come  
the hours have taken away my faith  
All I see is a light within  

The wind has started to feel pleasant  
The road ahead seems smooth enough  
I do not fear the road ahead  
for I just need to keep moving
