Sometimes I sit by  my window  
head resting  against the sill  
looking at the blank outside  
rummaging the void within  

Sometimes I just walk away  
running off the normal day  
and in those moments a few  
I find myself thinking about you  

Sometimes I just talk to myself  
debating and discussing in silence  
the things to say,the things to do  
if ever I stay sober in front of you  

Sometimes I picture you with me  
walking down the road together  
you rest you head on my heart  
I have held you close by my side  

Sometimes I forget who I am  
lost everytime I see you smiling  
your casual brushing your hair aside  
makes me smile blankly everytime  

Sometimes I wish all this was real  
Us holding hands,you smiling at me  
I wish you could see through me  
come to me and be mine truly
